// IEEE Std 1364-2005
//   10. Tasks and functions
//     10.3 Disabling of named blocks and tasks
//       This example shows the disable statement being used to disable concurrently a sequence of
//       timing controls and the task action when the reset event occurs. The example shows a
//       fork-join block within which are a named sequential block (event_expr) and a disable
//       statement that waits for occurrence of the event reset. The sequential block and the wait
//       for reset execute in parallel. The event_expr block waits for one occurrence of event ev1
//       and three occurrences of event trig. When these four events have happened, plus a delay
//       of d time units, the task action executes. When the event reset occurs, regardless
//       of events within the sequential block, the fork-join block terminatesâ€”including the task
//       action.
