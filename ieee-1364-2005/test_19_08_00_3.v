// IEEE Std 1364-2005
//   19. Compiler directives
//     19.8 `timescale
//       The following example shows a `timescale directive in the context of a module. The
//       `timescale 10 ns / 1 ns compiler directive specifies that the time unit for module test is
//       10 ns. As a result, the time values in the module are multiples of 10 ns, rounded to the
//       nearest 1 ns; therefore, the value stored in parameter d is scaled to a delay of 16 ns. In
//       other words, the value 0 is assigned to reg set at simulation time 16 ns (1.6 Ã— 10 ns),
//       and the value 1 at simulation time 32 ns.

// ! TYPE: POSITIVE
